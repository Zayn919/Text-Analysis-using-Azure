Disappointing and Frustrating Experience
Sunset Resort, Jaipur, India
9/12/2023

This resort is outdated and poorly maintained, clearly showing its age since it was built decades ago. The furniture in the room was worn out, and the bathroom fixtures were leaky and rusted. The air conditioning barely worked, leaving the room uncomfortably warm. To make matters worse, the staff seemed uninterested in addressing our concerns, and service was extremely slow. Despite the website claiming it’s close to Amer Fort, it’s a long, inconvenient drive through heavy traffic. The overall experience was disappointing, and we wouldn’t recommend staying here.
