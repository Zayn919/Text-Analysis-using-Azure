Decent Location but Lacking in Comfort
Silver Creek Hotel, Manali, India

We stayed here in June, hoping for a peaceful retreat in the hills. While the location offers easy access to Mall Road and local markets, the overall experience left much to be desired. The view from the balcony was pleasant, with lush greenery and snow-capped mountains in the distance. However, the rooms were cramped and poorly ventilated, making it uncomfortable during warmer afternoons. The staff was polite but seemed overwhelmed and unable to respond promptly to requests. Noise from the main road and nearby construction was constant, which took away from the serenity we were expecting. This place is okay for a short stay, but there are better options in the area.
