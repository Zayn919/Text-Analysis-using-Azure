Cramped and Noisy Stay
Mountain View Inn, Shimla, India
4/15/2023

The hotel is located along the main Shimla-Kalka road, which sees constant traffic from early morning to late at night, especially during the peak tourist season. The noise was unbearable, and the rooms offered no soundproofing whatsoever. I had to use earplugs just to get a few hours of sleep, which left me exhausted and unable to enjoy the beauty of Shimla the next day. The rooms were incredibly small – we booked one with two double beds, but there was barely any room to move around with our family of four. While the rooms were clean, and they had made an effort to modernize the interiors, the overall experience was far from relaxing. The location in the heart of the town is convenient, with cafes and shops nearby, but it might suit only young travelers who don’t mind the lack of comfort and constant noise.
